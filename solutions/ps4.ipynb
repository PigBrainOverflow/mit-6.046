    "3. First we prove that $D$ is always the subsequence of $Q$. Suppose after a sequence of operations, we have $Q$ and its subsequence $D$. If we $enqueue(Q, D, x)$, we will get $Q' = Q ++ [x]$ and $D' = D[:k] ++ [x]$ so $D'$ must be a subsequence of $Q'$ and for $dequeue(Q, D)$, we have $Q' = Q[1:]$ and $D' = Q[k:], k \\ge 1$. Obviously, $D$ is monotonically decreasing from tail to head. Next we should prove that $D$ is the longest decreasing subsequence of $Q$ containing $Q[-1]$. Suppose after a sequence of operations, we have $Q$ and $D$. For $enqueue(Q, D, x)$, we have $Q' = Q ++ [x]$ and $D' = D[:k] ++ [x]$, where $D[k:] \\ge x$. It's easy to see $D'$ is a subsequence of $Q'$ containing $Q'[-1]$, namely $x$. It's also longest: If not, namely there exists a subsequence $\\hat{D}$ that $\\hat{D} \\ge x, len(\\hat{D}) > len(D[:k])$, then $len(\\hat{D} ++ D[k:]) > len(D)$, which makes $D$ not optimal. For $dequeue(Q, D)$, if $Q[0]$ is not the minimum element in $Q$, then we just $Q.pop()$ and maintain the invariants, otherwise, we need to pop $D[0]$ too. We have $Q' = Q[1:], D' = D[1:]$ so $D'$ is still the longest decreasing subsequence of $Q'$ containing $Q'[-1]$.\n",
