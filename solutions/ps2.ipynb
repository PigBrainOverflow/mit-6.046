    "1. For each substring $S[i :]$, we do pattern matching. The total time complexity is $O(mn)$.\n",

    "For example, $S = ababbab, P = ab*$, we have $A_S = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1], A_P = [1, -1, 0]$. $A_M = A_S \\cdot reverse(A_P) = [0, -1, 2, -2, 2, 0, -2]$, so $M = [0, 2]$.\n",
    "3. First we extend $A_P$ and $A_S$ to $m+n$ degree (since the product of them is at most $m+n$ degree and we need $m+n$ samples), compute $A_S^* = FFT(A_S)$ and $A_P^* = FFT(A_P)$ in $O((m+n)log(m+n))$ time. Second, we compute their product in $O(m+n)$ time. Finally, apply IFFT to convert back in $O((m+n)log(m+n))$ time. The total time complexity is $O((m+n)log(m+n))$.\n",
    "4. Orthogonal Basis: Similar to 2 but this time we have $4$ distinct symbols to match. We need $4$ numbers: $u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3$ that $u_i^2 = 1$ and $u_i \\cdot u_j < 1, i \\ne j$. Unfortunately, this is impossible at least in the real number domain.  \n",
