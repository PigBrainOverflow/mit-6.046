Let $m = \\frac{V\\epsilon}{n}$, then $\\frac{v_i - m}{m} < v'_i = \\lfloor \\frac{v_i}{m} \\rfloor \\le \\frac{v_i}{m}$ and the solution by $Alg_4$ is $v \\ge mv'_{opt}$. The original optimal value $v_{opt}$ cannot exceed the scaled optimal value $m(v'_{opt} + n)$. (You can prove it by Pigeon Hole Theorem, and find the contradiction of $v'_{opt}$ is not optimal.) Therefore, the approximation ratio $=\\frac{v_{opt}}{v} \\le \\frac{v_{opt}}{mv'_{opt}} < \\frac{m(v'_{opt}+n)}{mv'_{opt}} = 1 + \\frac{n}{v'_{opt}}$. It's $(1 + V\\epsilon)$-approximation and FPTAS."
